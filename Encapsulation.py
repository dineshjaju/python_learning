# does not grant access since the credentails are invalid
Steve.login("steve", "6789")
Steve._User__password  # compilation error will occur due to this line

# In the above example, the fields __userName and __password are declared privately using the __ prefix.

# We can observe that no one can access, change, or print the __password and __userName fields directly from the main code. This is a proper implementation of encapsulation.
